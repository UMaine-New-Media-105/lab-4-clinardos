Exercise 1: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/v7FLU329g For this exercise, we began with a 400 by 400 sketch using the p5.js software. I was tasked to create three different functions that each would make a different shape. The three fuctions that I defined created three different shapes which were a triangle, an ellipse, and a rhombus. I used the triangle and ellipse comand. I also used the beginShape () command with vertex () to create my own rhombus. 

Exercise 2:https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/v7FLU329g Next, I continued on the same 400 by 400 canvas using the p5.js software. The task was to modify the functions to have a fill parameter. This had a catch though. The fill parameter must be an RGB value, and not a css name. I was able to instill this by creating 3 knobs within the parentheses of each function, this would be r,g, and b to stand for red, green, and blue. Example: myRhombus(r,g,b). Then within the function I added a fill and in the parantheses wrote the same parameters. This allows the color of the shape to be changed by the user when the function is called in draw.
